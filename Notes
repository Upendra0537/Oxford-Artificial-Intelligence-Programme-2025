GPT - General Purpose Technology
Characteristics
Pervasiveness: The technology spreads across most sectors.
Improvement: It will improve in quality over time and will continue to lower the costs of use.
Innovation: It enables other inventions.

Hype Cycle
Innovation trigger: The first stage in the cycle represents the period when the technology is first invented, which sparks excitement. This is usually triggered by media coverage resulting from a public announcement or a physical demonstration of the technology.
Peak of inflated expectation: During this period, hype and excitement builds, and optimism and imagination far exceeds the reality of the potential the technology holds. This stage is also known for investment into the technology without an understanding of it, and without a sound business case for the investment decision.
Trough of disillusionment: This period is when hope and faith in the technology is lost, because it is not performing as well as expected. Negative media coverage is widespread.
Slope of enlightenment: Confidence in the technology is regained, and the potential for further application of the technology becomes clear.
Plateau of productivity: During the maturity stage, growth slows down, the technology is realistically valued, and adoption accelerates.
